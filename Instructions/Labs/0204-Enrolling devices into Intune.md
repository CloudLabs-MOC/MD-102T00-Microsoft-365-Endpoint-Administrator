# Practice Lab: Enrolling devices into Microsoft Intune

## Summary

In this lab, you will join a Windows client to Azure AD and verify that the device has automatically enrolled into Microsoft Intune.

5. On the **Devices** blade, select **All devices** and verify that **SEA-WS1** is listed.

6. Note that for SEA-WS1, the **Managed by** column displays **Intune** and the **Ownership** column displays **Corporate**. 

   _Note: This view lists devices that are joined to Azure AD. Remember that you configured automatic enrollment between Azure AD and Intune, and because of that, any device that is joined to Azure AD is automatically enrolled in Intune. Any devices joined prior to setting up enrollment are only joined to Azure AD, but not enrolled in Intune._

7. Open a new tab in **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://entra.microsoft.com**, and then press **Enter**.

8. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, expand **Identity**.
